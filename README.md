I'm sharing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization of the data from Netflix using Python - A Data Analysis Project performed in my journey into Data Science.

## About the Project

Netflix is a streaming service that allows users to watch a wide variety of television shows, movies, documentaries, and more on internet-connected devices. It offers a vast library of content, including both licensed and original programming, and subscribers can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere. 
Here, l have explored and quantified data about movies and drawn valuable insights.

Conducted data cleaning to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization of the Netflix dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn).

Data analysis - Exploring the relationship between the duration of a movie and diffrent genres over time, involving sentiment analysis and many more.
